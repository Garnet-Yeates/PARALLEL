Ping-Pong:
In this algorithm, Rank 0 (R0) sends a message to each of the other ranks (R1 to Rn) one at a time and waits to receive a response from each rank before proceeding to the next one.
The communication pattern involves sequential exchanges, where R0 sends a message to R1, R2, and so on, while each rank receives from the previous rank.
The number of send/receive pairs is equal to [(numRanks - 1) * 2], resulting in multiple transfers.
The code calculates the amount of data transferred in gigabytes (gbTransferred) based on the number of ranks, and measures the time elapsed for the communication.
The expected time to complete this algorithm is longer than the ring algorithm due to the higher amount of data being transferred.
