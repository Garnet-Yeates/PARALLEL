Number of tasks = 10, My rank = 0, Running on zarya
Assumed max amount of doubles we can fit per gb: 134217728
Assumed max amount of doubles we can fit for 16gb ram: 2147483648
Our matrix size is: 5040 x 5040. So the number of doubles we are putting in RAM is 25401600
Matrix being initialized on source (rank 0): OMITTED
