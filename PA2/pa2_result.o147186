Number of tasks = 10, My rank = 0, Running on zarya
Assumed max amount of doubles we can fit per gb: 134217728
Assumed max amount of doubles we can fit for 16gb ram: 2147483648
Total Operations: 914487840
Operations per node: 91448784
Total Nodes: 10
Our matrix size is: 30240 x 30240. So the number of doubles we are putting in RAM is 914457600
