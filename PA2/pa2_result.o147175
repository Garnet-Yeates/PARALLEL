Number of tasks = 2, My rank = 0, Running on winston
Assumed max amount of doubles we can fit per gb: 134217728
Assumed max amount of doubles we can fit for 16gb ram: 2147483648
Total Operations: 914487840
Operations per node: 457243920
Total Nodes: 2
Our matrix size is: 30240 x 30240. So the number of doubles we are putting in RAM is 914457600
Matrix being initialized on source (rank 0): OMITTED
Number of tasks = 2, My rank = 1, Running on roadhog
This matrix will be multiplied by the following vector: OMITTED
FOR MATRIX SIZE 30240 x 30240, (2 RANKS), SCATTER TIME IS: 4.668429
FOR MATRIX SIZE 30240 x 30240, (2 RANKS), GATHER TIME IS: 0.000706
TIME TO SOLUTION FOR 2 RANKS 8.136125
Result has been gathered back to source (rank 0): OMITTED
