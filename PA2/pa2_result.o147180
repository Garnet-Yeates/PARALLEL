Number of tasks = 5, My rank = 0, Running on winston
Assumed max amount of doubles we can fit per gb: 134217728
Assumed max amount of doubles we can fit for 16gb ram: 2147483648
Total Operations: 914487840
Operations per node: 182897568
Total Nodes: 5
Our matrix size is: 30240 x 30240. So the number of doubles we are putting in RAM is 914457600
Matrix being initialized on source (rank 0): OMITTED
Number of tasks = 5, My rank = 2, Running on mccree
Number of tasks = 5, My rank = 4, Running on junkrat
Number of tasks = 5, My rank = 1, Running on roadhog
Number of tasks = 5, My rank = 3, Running on bastion
This matrix will be multiplied by the following vector: OMITTED
FOR MATRIX SIZE 30240 x 30240, (5 RANKS), SCATTER TIME IS: 6.026665
FOR MATRIX SIZE 30240 x 30240, (5 RANKS), GATHER TIME IS: 0.002717
TIME TO SOLUTION FOR 5 RANKS 7.409833
Result has been gathered back to source (rank 0): OMITTED
