Number of tasks = 9, My rank = 0, Running on zarya
Assumed max amount of doubles we can fit per gb: 134217728
Assumed max amount of doubles we can fit for 16gb ram: 2147483648
Total Operations: 914487840
Operations per node: 101609760
Total Nodes: 9
Our matrix size is: 30240 x 30240. So the number of doubles we are putting in RAM is 914457600
Matrix being initialized on source (rank 0): OMITTED
Number of tasks = 9, My rank = 3, Running on orisa
Number of tasks = 9, My rank = 4, Running on lucio
Number of tasks = 9, My rank = 2, Running on roadhog
Number of tasks = 9, My rank = 6, Running on sombra
Number of tasks = 9, My rank = 8, Running on soldier
Number of tasks = 9, My rank = 7, Running on reaper
Number of tasks = 9, My rank = 5, Running on tracer
