Number of tasks = 8, My rank = 0, Running on zarya
Assumed max amount of doubles we can fit per gb: 134217728
Assumed max amount of doubles we can fit for 16gb ram: 2147483648
Total Operations: 914487840
Operations per node: 114310980
Total Nodes: 8
Our matrix size is: 30240 x 30240. So the number of doubles we are putting in RAM is 914457600
Matrix being initialized on source (rank 0): OMITTED
Number of tasks = 8, My rank = 5, Running on tracer
Number of tasks = 8, My rank = 7, Running on reaper
Number of tasks = 8, My rank = 6, Running on sombra
Number of tasks = 8, My rank = 3, Running on orisa
Number of tasks = 8, My rank = 2, Running on roadhog
Number of tasks = 8, My rank = 1, Running on winston
Number of tasks = 8, My rank = 4, Running on lucio
This matrix will be multiplied by the following vector: OMITTED
FOR MATRIX SIZE 30240 x 30240, (8 RANKS), SCATTER TIME IS: 6.260402
FOR MATRIX SIZE 30240 x 30240, (8 RANKS), GATHER TIME IS: 0.001406
TIME TO SOLUTION FOR 8 RANKS 7.146563
Result has been gathered back to source (rank 0): OMITTED
