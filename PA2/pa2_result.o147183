Number of tasks = 7, My rank = 0, Running on winston
Assumed max amount of doubles we can fit per gb: 134217728
Assumed max amount of doubles we can fit for 16gb ram: 2147483648
Total Operations: 914487840
Operations per node: 130641120
Total Nodes: 7
Our matrix size is: 30240 x 30240. So the number of doubles we are putting in RAM is 914457600
Matrix being initialized on source (rank 0): OMITTED
Number of tasks = 7, My rank = 6, Running on torbjorn
Number of tasks = 7, My rank = 2, Running on soldier
Number of tasks = 7, My rank = 4, Running on bastion
Number of tasks = 7, My rank = 1, Running on roadhog
Number of tasks = 7, My rank = 3, Running on mccree
Number of tasks = 7, My rank = 5, Running on junkrat
This matrix will be multiplied by the following vector: OMITTED
FOR MATRIX SIZE 30240 x 30240, (7 RANKS), SCATTER TIME IS: 6.241482
FOR MATRIX SIZE 30240 x 30240, (7 RANKS), GATHER TIME IS: 0.034309
TIME TO SOLUTION FOR 7 RANKS 7.261877
Result has been gathered back to source (rank 0): OMITTED
